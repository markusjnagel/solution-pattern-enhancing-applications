== Adding API Management capabilities to the application

=== Introduction

To support the business requirement of managing and securing access to the services, Red HatÂ® OpenShift API Management (RHOAM) will be used as the API management platform. 

RHOAM is a hosted and managed API management service delivered as an add-on product to Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, a fully managed service of enterprise Kubernetes platform Red Hat OpenShift, and also on Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS (ROSA)


=== Activities

In this part of the workshop you will:

* Setup a RHOAM sandbox environment
* Manage and secure the already deployed Product catalog service.


=== Environment and prerequisites

The *Product catalog API* is already deployed on the OpenShift cluster in the namespace you've been using for this portion of the workshop. You will use the  Red Hat OpenShift API management sandbox to manage this API.  All activities in this part of the workshop can be done in the RHOAMsandbox console and do not require any tools to be installed on your workstation. 

Prerequisites:

* A Red Hat Account 


=== Step-By-Step Instructions


==== Signup and launch Red Hat OpenShift API Management sandbox

Register for a RHOAM sandbox by clicking on the red button in the https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/activities/share-java--applications-openshift-api-management[user activities page]

You will be asked to confirm the request through an email sent to your inbox. Once you launch the sandbox, follow these steps to setup an RHOAM sandbox tenant

* From the *Projects* dropdown on the top of the page, set the project namespace as *<username>-dev* from the projects that have been already created for you.
* Click on *Search* from the left navigation
* Click on *Resources* to search for `APIManagementTenant` and select it. 
+
image::04/tenant-search.png[width=100%]
* Select *Create APIManagementTenant* button
+
image::04/create-APIManagementTenant.png[width=100%]
* You will be taken to the YAML configuration of this resource. Click the  Create button at the bottom of the YAML displayed.
* You will be taken to the Details page of this resource. Click on the YAML tab to view the changes to the YAML configuration.
* Watch for changes to the YAML of the APIManagementTenant resource, and wait for  the status to be displayed at the bottom of the YAML to become `status.provisioningStatus: 3scale account ready`
+

==== Configure and manage your API 
The following sections will guide you through 

* creating a Product
* creating a Backend
* defining Method, Metrics and Mapping rules
* creating an application plans 
* creating an application for the default account/audience

==== Create an API Product

A product is a customer-facing API that packages one or more backends. You will create an API  Product manually with the following instructions

. In a browser window navigate to the Red Hat OpenShift API Management
. In the Dashboard, under the APIs section, click *Create Product* in the *_Products_* card.
+
image::04/rhoam-dashboard.png[Red Hat OpenShift API Management Dashboard]
. Provide the following details:
+
image::04/create-product.png[width=100%]
+
* *Name*: `globex-product-catalog`
* *System name*: `globex-product`
* *Description*: `Optional field containing more details about the product.`

. Click *Create Product*.
. A Product `globex-product-catalog` is created and you are taken to the Product Overview page

==== Create an API Backend

The next step is to create a Backend which for the Product Catalogue API which you will then add to the Product you've created in the previous step

. Go to the Dashboard.
. Under the APIs section, click Create Backend in the *_Backends_* card.
. Provide the following details:
+
image::04/create-backend.png[]
* *Name*: `globex-catalog`.
* *System name*: `globex-catalog`.
* *Description*: `Optional field containing more details about the backend`.
* *Private endpoint*: Base URL of the Product Catalog API.
+ 
[NOTE]
====
Here are instruction how to access the Private Endpoint of the Product Catalog API.

* Access the Developer Perspective Topology of the OpenShift enviroment where the Globex application has been deployed
* Click on the *catalog-service icon* and you will see the deployment details popup on the right hand side
+
image::04/globex-deployment-topology-catalog-service.png[]
* Copy the Location as present at the bottom of this under Routes. This would look something like this `https://catalog-globex-recommendation.apps.cluster-pppk8.pppk8.sandbox45.opentlc.com:443`
====

. Click *Create Backend*.

==== Define Method, Metrics and Mapping rules

*_Setup a new Method_*

. Navigate to the Product > globex-catalog > Integration > Methods & Metrics
. Click *New method*
. Provide the following details:
+
image::04/new-method.png[]
* *Friendly name*: `getPaginatedProductsList`
* *System name*: `getPaginatedProductsList`
. Click *Create Method*


*_Setup a new Metric_*

. Navigate to the Product > globex-catalog > Integration > Methods & Metrics
. Click *New metric*
. Provide the following details:
+
image::04/new-metric.png[]
* *Friendly name*: `Hits`
* *System name*: `hits`
* *Unit*: `hit`
* *Description*: `Number of API hits`
. Click *Create Metric*

*_Setup a new Mapping Rule_*


. Navigate to the Product > globex-catalog > Integration > Mapping Rules
